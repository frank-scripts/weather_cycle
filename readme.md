Weather Cycling Script for FiveM
Introduction ???????
I created this weather cycling script because I noticed something missing in the FiveM scripting community:
a weather system that cycles dynamically between snow, blizzard, and other weather types!
Sure, there are plenty of weather-control resources, but none that seamlessly cycle through winter and clear weather conditions
in an engaging and server-friendly way.

This script is not only simple to set up but also highly customizable. It overrides resources like qb-weather, ensuring your custom weather cycle runs uninterrupted. While using this script, direct weather changes from other resources like qb-weather will no longer work, giving you full control over your server’s environment. ??

Features ??
Dynamic Weather Cycling: Automatically cycles between snow, blizzard, and other weather conditions.
Customizable Intervals: Easily adjust how often the weather changes.
Lightweight and Efficient: Runs smoothly on any FiveM server.
Permission Control: Add ACE permissions to allow admins to override weather conditions manually.
Framework Agnostic: Works regardless of your server's framework (ESX, QBCore, or standalone).
How It Works ???
The script includes a server-side loop that cycles through a predefined list of weather types (XMAS, BLIZZARD, SNOW, etc.). It uses FiveM’s native weather-setting functions to ensure weather syncs across all players. A client-side script handles smooth transitions between weather types for a polished user experience.

Key Components:
Server-Side Script (weather_cycle.lua):

Defines the weather types.
Handles the weather cycling logic with a timed loop.
Sends weather updates to all connected clients.
Client-Side Script (client.lua):

Receives the weather type from the server.
Applies the weather change smoothly using FiveM natives.
Permission System (Optional):

ACE permissions can be configured to allow admins to manually override the weather.
Installation ??
Download and Extract:

Place the script in your FiveM server's resources folder under a directory named weather_cycle.
Add to server.cfg:

ensure weather_cycle
Grant Permissions (Optional): To allow specific groups to override weather, add the following to your server.cfg:

add_ace group.admin command.weather allow

Enjoy the Dynamic Weather!

Customization ??
Adjusting Weather Types
Want to add or remove weather conditions? Edit the weatherCycle array in weather_cycle.lua:

local weatherCycle = {
    "XMAS",
    "BLIZZARD",
    "SNOWLIGHT",
    "SNOW",
    "SMOG",
    "CLEAR",
    "NEUTRAL",
    "EXTRASUNNY"
}
Replace or rearrange weather types based on your preferences. Available options include:

CLEAR
CLOUDS
SMOG
FOGGY
OVERCAST
RAIN
THUNDER
SNOW
SNOWLIGHT
XMAS


Adjusting Weather Change Interval
To change how often the weather cycles, edit the weatherChangeInterval value in milliseconds:

local weatherChangeInterval = 300000 -- 5 minutes
For example:

1 minute: 60000
10 minutes: 600000


Granting Weather Override Permissions
If you want specific players or groups to manually set the weather, configure ACE permissions in your server.cfg:

add_ace group.admin command.weather allow
Code Breakdown ??
weather_cycle.lua (Server-Side)
lua
Copy code
local weatherCycle = { "XMAS", "BLIZZARD", "SNOWLIGHT", "SNOW", "SMOG", "CLEAR", "NEUTRAL", "EXTRASUNNY" }
local currentWeatherIndex = 1
local weatherChangeInterval = 300000 -- Change every 5 minutes

local function updateWeather()
    local weatherType = weatherCycle[currentWeatherIndex]
    TriggerClientEvent('vfx:setWeather', -1, weatherType) -- Sync weather
    currentWeatherIndex = (currentWeatherIndex % #weatherCycle) + 1 -- Cycle to the next weather
end

CreateThread(function()
    while true do
        updateWeather()
        Wait(weatherChangeInterval)
    end
end)
weatherCycle: Array of weather types to cycle through.
weatherChangeInterval: Controls the frequency of weather changes.
updateWeather: Sends weather updates to all players using a client event.


client.lua (Client-Side)

RegisterNetEvent('vfx:setWeather', function(weatherType)
    SetWeatherTypeOverTime(weatherType, 15.0) -- Smooth transition
    Wait(15000)
    ClearOverrideWeather()
    ClearWeatherTypePersist()
    SetWeatherTypePersist(weatherType)
    SetWeatherTypeNow(weatherType)
end)

SetWeatherTypeOverTime: Smoothly transitions to the new weather type.
SetWeatherTypePersist: Ensures the weather type remains active until the next update.
Why Use This Script? ??
